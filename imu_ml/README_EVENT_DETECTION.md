# Real-Time Driving Event Detection for Raspberry Pi

This system adds real-time event detection to your existing IMU data collection setup. It detects driving events like straight driving, turns, bumps, and potholes using accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Copy Files to Raspberry Pi
Copy these files to your Raspberry Pi in the same folder as your `new.py`:
- `event_detector.py`
- `integrate_event_detection.py`

### 2. Install Dependencies
On your Raspberry Pi, install NumPy:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### 3. Start Event Detection
1. First, start your main data collection system:
   ```bash
   python new.py
   ```

2. In a **separate terminal**, start the event detection:
   ```bash
   python integrate_event_detection.py
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Event Types Detected:
- **Straight**: Stable driving with minimal turning
- **Left Turn**: Vehicle turning left (detected via gyroscope)
- **Right Turn**: Vehicle turning right (detected via gyroscope)  
- **Bump**: Upward road irregularities (detected via accelerometer)
- **Pothole**: Downward road irregularities (detected via accelerometer)

### Output Format:
Events are logged to `events.csv` in each ride folder with:
```csv
timestamp,event
2025-09-13_22-34-50-275,right_turn
2025-09-13_22-34-51-449,bump
```

### Detection Parameters:
- **Window Size**: 10 samples (2 seconds at 5Hz)
- **Turn Detection**: ±15°/s gyroscope Z-axis threshold
- **Straight Driving**: <5°/s gyroscope activity
- **Bump Detection**: >1.2g upward acceleration spike
- **Pothole Detection**: <0.6g downward acceleration drop

## 📁 File Structure
After running, your data folders will look like:
```
data/
├── ride01/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── combined_data.csv    # Original IMU data
│   └── events.csv          # NEW: Detected events
├── ride02/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── combined_data.csv
│   └── events.csv
```

## 🔧 System Integration

The event detection system:
- ✅ **Does NOT modify** your existing `new.py` code
- ✅ Automatically detects when data collection starts/stops
- ✅ Creates `events.csv` files in each ride folder
- ✅ Processes data in real-time as it's collected
- ✅ Handles multiple ride sessions automatically

## 📊 Real-Time Monitoring

The system provides console output showing detected events:
```
🎯 EVENT DETECTED: RIGHT_TURN at 2025-09-13_22-34-50-275
🎯 EVENT DETECTED: BUMP at 2025-09-13_22-34-51-449
```

## ⚙️ Customization

You can adjust detection sensitivity by modifying thresholds in `event_detector.py`:
```python
# In EventDetector.__init__()
self.TURN_GYRO_Z_THRESHOLD = 15.0      # Increase for less sensitive turn detection
self.BUMP_ACCEL_Z_THRESHOLD = 1.2      # Increase for less sensitive bump detection
self.POTHOLE_ACCEL_Z_THRESHOLD = 0.6   # Decrease for more sensitive pothole detection
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "NumPy not found"
**Solution**: Install NumPy with `pip install numpy`

### Issue: "event_detector.py not found"
**Solution**: Ensure both Python files are in the same directory

### Issue: No events detected
**Solution**: 
1. Check that your main data collection is running
2. Verify `combined_data.csv` files are being created
3. Try adjusting detection thresholds for your specific vehicle/road conditions

### Issue: Too many false events
**Solution**: Increase the threshold values in `event_detector.py`

## 📈 Performance

- **CPU Usage**: Minimal (processes data every 200ms)
- **Memory Usage**: ~10MB for rolling window buffer
- **Latency**: ~2-4 seconds from IMU reading to event detection
- **Accuracy**: Tuned for typical automotive scenarios

## 🔄 Stopping the System

To stop event detection:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the event detection terminal
2. The system will automatically cleanup and show final statistics

The event detection will automatically stop when your main data collection stops.
